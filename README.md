# ninacarducci

The goal of this project was to offer Nina Carducci, a photographer, an SEO optimisation service. I worked on several aspects to improve the local SEO performance of her site. This included adding appropriate metadata for social networks to optimise sharing on these platforms.
I also carried out technical optimisations in terms of the site's code and structure to improve its accessibility to search engines. Particular attention was paid to optimising images to reduce their size without compromising their quality. Ultimately, my aim was to improve the SEO of Nina's site in order to increase its online visibility and attract more potential customers.
I provided a full optimisation report and optimised code to enable Nina to implement the recommendations.
